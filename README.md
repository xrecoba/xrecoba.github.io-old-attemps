# About Me
I'm Xavi Ametller. I've been developing Software since 2003 and during those years I've done my fair share of mistakes, I even learnt something from some of them. Somehow during this trip it came to me the opportunity to teach and I did like it, a lot.

Other persons and companies also seem to appreciate my collaboration as consultant (still wonder why, but who am I to discuss with them - the only thing I can say is 'It depends')
