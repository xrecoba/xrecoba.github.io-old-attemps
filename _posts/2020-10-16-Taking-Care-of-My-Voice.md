Going fully remote in a job which pair or mob programming is the norm forced my voice to a level where it started to suffer ( I also tried to sang every once in a while, guess that also contributed) .
To work on my problem, I started visiting Ester Dom√®nech and I've made a small summary of the tips she has given me so far. There's a lot of work under the hood related to exercicing my voice and improving my bad habits with Ester, but that part is beyond my understanding.
